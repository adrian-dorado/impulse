Today we worked on:

    Getting our poller up along with creating our models and some views. Our React page is also up, it seems like the project is off to a good start. Also, it was our first time using live share and we found it more helpful to work in pairs rather than with the whole group.

Today we worked on:

    We reformatted our project specs to combine our 4 microservices into two. Adrian and I will be combining users and subscriptions, while Nellie and Evan will be combing the two different subscription boxes. We came to this decision because when we were trying to create our outline for polling and models we realized that we were creating a lot more work for ourselves than we needed to.

Today we worked on:

    Getting the django app up and running. Something new I learned today was that you can create your own git short cuts.
