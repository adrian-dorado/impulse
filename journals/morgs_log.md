# 7/21

    Today we worked on:

        Today we worked more on our pages, Adrian added a checkout page for us. We have started working on the Auth page but it was a bit confusing an a little slow going, hopefully we will be able to finish that up today and get the checkout feature up and running :)

# 7/20

    Today we worked on:

        Today Adrian and I got the footer and header looking really nice and cohesive! Our group talked about starting the Auth and possibly assigning it to someone but we decided to do it has a group tomorrow!

# 7/19

    Today we worked on:

        We have our base pages set up! The sign up form is working and the Home page. There were still issues with Docker, but we are hopefully done with that. I know it is suppose to help seemliness work between different OS, but when we go from Windows to Mac sometimes it freaks out. We tried to use MDBootstrap but it has seemed to clash with regular bootstrap so we are removing it.

# 7/18

    Today we worked on:

        Got the poller 100% working and fixed some classic Docker nonsense. We have begun working on our front pages, like the Home page, and setting up our Nav bar and Footers. Once we have all of those set up we will be diving into our project a little more and adding things that we see fit.

# 7/15

Today we worked on:

    Today got a little crazy with our Docker and building files. After many hours and a lot of help it turns out that the file did not like that Adrian was running it on their Windows, and that it is fine running on a Mac. I am really curious to see if any other teams come across this issue. This took a lot out of us all today, but it was a great ad for Apple products :)

# 7/14

Today we worked on:

    We basically completed our backend today! All the views, models and urls are done for the subscriptions and the products. I feel like we got this project up and running so quickly, I am super proud of us!! Now to get the poller up and we will be all set to move on to the front end.

# 7/13

Today we worked on:

    Getting our poller up along with creating our models and some views. Our React page is also up, it seems like the project is off to a good start. Also, it was our first time using live share and we found it more helpful to work in pairs rather than with the whole group.

# 7/12

Today we worked on:

    We reformatted our project specs to combine our 4 microservices into two. Adrian and I will be combining users and subscriptions, while Nellie and Evan will be combing the two different subscription boxes. We came to this decision because when we were trying to create our outline for polling and models we realized that we were creating a lot more work for ourselves than we needed to.

# 7/11

Today we worked on:

    Getting the django app up and running. Something new I learned today was that you can create your own git short cuts.
