Today we worked on:

    Today got a little crazy with our Docker and building files. After many hours and a lot of help it turns out that the file did not like that Adrian was running it on their Windows, and that it is fine running on a Mac. I am really curious to see if any other teams come across this issue. This took a lot out of us all today, but it was a great ad for Apple products :)

Today we worked on:

    We basically completed our backend today! All the views, models and urls are done for the subscriptions and the products. I feel like we got this project up and running so quickly, I am super proud of us!! Now to get the poller up and we will be all set to move on to the front end.

Today we worked on:

    Getting our poller up along with creating our models and some views. Our React page is also up, it seems like the project is off to a good start. Also, it was our first time using live share and we found it more helpful to work in pairs rather than with the whole group.

# 7/12

Today we worked on:

    We reformatted our project specs to combine our 4 microservices into two. Adrian and I will be combining users and subscriptions, while Nellie and Evan will be combing the two different subscription boxes. We came to this decision because when we were trying to create our outline for polling and models we realized that we were creating a lot more work for ourselves than we needed to.

# 7/11

Today we worked on:

    Getting the django app up and running. Something new I learned today was that you can create your own git short cuts.
