Today the entire team worked on:
* Theorizing how the pollers will work and scaling from four microservices to two.

Today was something I wasn't expecting at ALL. It felt so strange just to nuke half of our project, but still end up with the same functionality.
It was actually pretty neat to take a step back and reoutline what we needed to do. Now we have a project with everything set up to funnel data
into the proper places and queries will be MUCH easier with this implementation.

Today the entire team worked on:
* Getting the entire backend for the web app laid out!

We spent a lot of time touching base on things and getting our models in order before even getting set up. Once we had that, we each added our parts to the yaml file, and created our Microservices (Django projects + apps). My specific microservice being Users, which comes with the Users and Quiz models.

It was really great FINALLY getting to see what that create-multiple-databases file does. I'm not the biggest fan of implementing code into my projects without knowing the "Why" behind it; I'm so excited we got to get our hands on it and figure out how to set it up with our projects. 

I think this is going to be a very fun project with very little stress as long as we keep communication up.
