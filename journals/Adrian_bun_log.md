## Just 14th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*  Finishing up the loose ends on our backend! We have pretty much all of our views working 
        and now we just need to create a bunch of products for the store/make the poller!

                I did NOT expect us to be done so quickly with backend, it almost feels *wrong*, but then I realize that we're 
        finally starting to come into our own as software engineers. This sort of stuff is feeling easy because we have 
        practiced so much that making the connections isn't *hard* at this point. 
        I learned that the UUID field exists and that makes custom, unique skus for the field you put it on, and that makes
        the process of adding our inventory so much faster than it would have been before.~

Today the entire team worked on:
*   We fully made the move to two microservices! The entire team also worked on setting up their views and models, I also managed to get the poller set up
    and loading without any crashes.

                Getting to sit down and write a bunch of code felt incredibly good. It feels like it has been a while that I have gotten a chance 
        to dig my teeth into some proper backend. I really enjoy creating APIs with Django and using Insomnia is such an easy time (although that
        definitely took some practice to perfect ðŸ˜…)
        Today was my first exposure to Live Share which was a little rocky to start, but Morgan and I ended up using it to GREAT success 
        while making the views for our microservice.

Today the entire team worked on:
*   Theorizing how the pollers will work and scaling from four microservices to two.

                Today was something I wasn't expecting at ALL. It felt so strange just to nuke half of our project, but still end up with the same functionality.
        It was actually pretty neat to take a step back and reoutline what we needed to do. Now we have a project with everything set up to funnel data
        into the proper places and queries will be MUCH easier with this implementation.

Today the entire team worked on:
* Getting the entire backend for the web app laid out!

                We spent a lot of time touching base on things and getting our models in order before even getting set up. 
        Once we had that, we each added our parts to the yaml file, and created our Microservices (Django projects + apps). 
        My specific microservice being Users, which comes with the Users and Quiz models.
                It was really great FINALLY getting to see what that create-multiple-databases file does. 
        I'm not the biggest fan of implementing code into my projects without knowing the "Why" behind it; 
        I'm so excited we got to get our hands on it and figure out how to set it up with our projects. 
        I think this is going to be a very fun project with very little stress as long as we keep communication up.
