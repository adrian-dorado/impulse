Whoo! Finally caught up with the journals. Not sure how I forgot seeing as I'm the one that
reminds my team about them daily... Anyways! Today was a bit more conceptiual as we 
decided on a color scheme for the project and ended up with a nice set of blues 
with a cream/off white background.

Journal Entry:

                I loved today!! We got to do arsty stuff which I loooove. Whenever we make
        product mock ups, I'm gonna get to use my drawing tablet and stuff!! It's really
        important to remember that as important code is, you won't be happy with a site if it
        doesn't look like how we want it to.

This is a slighly late journal entry! Yesterday, we discussed how we're 
gonna handle the front end, and ended up preparing the poller for launch.

Journal Entry:

                Today was interesting! We got to talk a lot about our design choices and it felt like the website was finally
        staring to become its own thing. I'm really happy with how everything has been working so far. I couldn't think of 
        a funner team to be on as we all really get along!

This is a late journal entry! I remember Friday we fixed the databases and oh my goodness was that a full adventure.

                Today we ended up dealing with the database issues that have been plauging us for some time now.
        To be quite frank, dealing with this was a bit of a nightmare, I stayed up till about 5am trying to workshop a solution.
        It wasn't actually any of my code, it ended up being a windows issue with line endings... ouch!
        I learned the difference between dos and bash and I'm a better person all around for it.

Today the entire team worked on:
*  Finishing up the loose ends on our backend! We have pretty much all of our views working 
        and now we just need to create a bunch of products for the store/make the poller! 

Journal Entry:

                I did NOT expect us to be done so quickly with backend, it almost feels *wrong*, but then I realize that we're 
        finally starting to come into our own as software engineers. This sort of stuff is feeling easy because we have 
        practiced 
        so much that making the connections isn't *hard* at this point. 
        I learned that the UUID field exists and that makes custom, unique skus for the field you put it on, and that makes
        the process of adding our inventory so much faster than it would have been before.~

## July 13th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*   We fully made the move to two microservices! The entire team also worked on setting up their views and models, I also managed to get the poller set up
    and loading without any crashes.

                Getting to sit down and write a bunch of code felt incredibly good. It feels like it has been a while that I have gotten a chance 
        to dig my teeth into some proper backend. I really enjoy creating APIs with Django and using Insomnia is such an easy time (although that
        definitely took some practice to perfect ðŸ˜…)
        Today was my first exposure to Live Share which was a little rocky to start, but Morgan and I ended up using it to GREAT success 
        while making the views for our microservice.

## July 12th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*   Theorizing how the pollers will work and scaling from four microservices to two.

Journal Entry:

                Today was something I wasn't expecting at ALL. It felt so strange just to nuke half of our project, but still end up with the same functionality.
        It was actually pretty neat to take a step back and reoutline what we needed to do. Now we have a project with everything set up to funnel data
        into the proper places and queries will be MUCH easier with this implementation.

## July 11th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
* Getting the entire backend for the web app laid out!

Journal Entry:

                We spent a lot of time touching base on things and getting our models in order before even getting set up. 
        Once we had that, we each added our parts to the yaml file, and created our Microservices (Django projects + apps). 
        My specific microservice being Users, which comes with the Users and Quiz models.
                It was really great FINALLY getting to see what that create-multiple-databases file does. 
        I'm not the biggest fan of implementing code into my projects without knowing the "Why" behind it; 
        I'm so excited we got to get our hands on it and figure out how to set it up with our projects. 
        I think this is going to be a very fun project with very little stress as long as we keep communication up.
