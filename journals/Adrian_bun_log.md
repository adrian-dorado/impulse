July 31st, 2022

Super cool surprise journal entry!
I got a bit nervous about missing some functionality and needing more time, so I decided to get a jump on functionality
stuff we needed and I am pretty close to getting the base functionality down! Once a receipt prints in the database from the frontend,
then that means everything is working and life is good!

Journal Entry:

                I definitely feel a bit bad working on the project without my team closeby, but people have busy lives and
        I only did a little bit, so I shouldn't feel wholly bad for doing stuff on the project. I think they'll be happy 
        that we're so close to the finish line!
        I learned that I miss company when working on projects.


July 28th, 2022

We didn't have that much time to work together today due to some technical difficulties across the team and
ended up just normalizing some text in the app and working on the design elements.

Journal Entry:

                It's so interesting to see how the aesthetics of a site change over time. 
        I think we've gone through like four different navbars and footers. It's pretty funny to see
        all the changes happen over time, it'd be neat to have a timelapse of that or something. 
        I learned that design is one of my favorite things in React! Functionality and stuff to come this weekend.

## July 27th, 2022

I.. I am speechless. We got it to work, we printed a token and actually celebrated. It was such a good feeling to cheer
with my team about this thing we've been struggling with for so long. Now the next thing to come is functionality and deployment!!

Journal Entry:

                WOW, I am so excited that we got this stuff working and, looking back on it, it shocks
        me that we didn't get it sooner, but we FINALLY got it and I could say the thing I learned today was authorization.
        Teamwork is pretty darn fun when you get to celebrate your victories. 

## July 26th, 2022

This week is still struggling with authorization and it's starting to feel bad, but we're gonna try again tomorrow.
I feel odd being negative in these journals, but not every day is gonna be a good one in regards to code.

Journal Entry:

                We did get closer on the auth, but we didn't really have enough time to get everything together.
        Tomorrow we're gonna try the rest of our ideas to get the auth working, I'm sure it's gonna be great!
        I learned to take failures in stride and try again tomorrow, things will always be different the next day.

## July 25th, 2022

Together, we tried getting the auth stuff to work to no avail, but we're gonna try again tomorrow and it should be better.
I think it's more difficult do this sort of setup than before because it isn't as guided, but I'm sure we could put our brains
together and find a good solution.

Journal Entry:

                Despite feeling lost, every time I look at the auth documentents, I feel like I get a bit closer to understanding
        what's going on in them. I feel like I had a breakthrough and I'm gonna try it out now, hopefully it works. The journal will definitely
        hear about it tomorrow if we/I do! Today I learned how to use inline CSS to help myself create CSS classes on the spot for testing.

## July 22nd, 2022

Mandatory fun! We fixed our main branch after borking it a bit and then headed off to mandatory fun!!

## July 21st, 2022

Today we took on authorizationand oh my goodness was it kind of a lot. The whole team felt confused as to what
to do until we ended up finding out the learn was very helpful and we just weren't reading far enough
into it ðŸ˜…

Journal Entry:

                I felt.. odd not being able to figure out the auth stuff. I have been very good about learning
        the topics and applying the information where it's needed, but this was very difficult apply.
        It was a very good reminder in the lesson of "I don't know everything about this yet and
        I have a lot ahead of me. I just have to keep reminding myself that things will come to me the more I practice
        and that is perfectly okay.

## July 20th, 2022

Today we spent as good amount of time getting our react pages fully cleaned up and discussed getting our Auth to work. 
We are reading the auth token cookbook and trying to make sure we fully understand what we're doing before we
actually put our hands on any of the code.

Journal Entry: 

                Today I ended up helping Morgan work on her footer and we finally fully finished it!!
        It looks very clean and matches our navbar extremely well. Getting that working was pretty much the
        final step for "static" react content and the rest of the code should be very easy to implement.
        I really hope we have minimum viable product by Friday!!!

## July 19th, 2022

Whoo! Finally caught up with the journals. Not sure how I forgot seeing as I'm the one that
reminds my team about them daily... Anyways! Today was a bit more conceptiual as we 
decided on a color scheme for the project and ended up with a nice set of blues 
with a cream/off white background.

Journal Entry:

                I loved today!! We got to do arsty stuff which I loooove. Whenever we make
        product mock ups, I'm gonna get to use my drawing tablet and stuff!! It's really
        important to remember that as important code is, you won't be happy with a site if it
        doesn't look like how we want it to.


## July 18th, 2022

This is a slighly late journal entry! Yesterday, we discussed how we're 
gonna handle the front end, and ended up preparing the poller for launch.

Journal Entry:

                Today was interesting! We got to talk a lot about our design choices and it felt like the website was finally
        staring to become its own thing. I'm really happy with how everything has been working so far. I couldn't think of 
        a funner team to be on as we all really get along!
        

## July 15th, 2022

This is a late journal entry! I remember Friday we fixed the databases and oh my goodness was that a full adventure.

Journal Entry:
---

                Today we ended up dealing with the database issues that have been plauging us for some time now.
        To be quite frank, dealing with this was a bit of a nightmare, I stayed up till about 5am trying to workshop a solution.
        It wasn't actually any of my code, it ended up being a windows issue with line endings... ouch!
        I learned the difference between dos and bash and I'm a better person all around for it.

## July 14th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*  Finishing up the loose ends on our backend! We have pretty much all of our views working 
        and now we just need to create a bunch of products for the store/make the poller! 

Journal Entry:
---

                I did NOT expect us to be done so quickly with backend, it almost feels *wrong*, but then I realize that we're 
        finally starting to come into our own as software engineers. This sort of stuff is feeling easy because we have 
        practiced 
        so much that making the connections isn't *hard* at this point. 
        I learned that the UUID field exists and that makes custom, unique skus for the field you put it on, and that makes
        the process of adding our inventory so much faster than it would have been before.~

## July 13th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*   We fully made the move to two microservices! The entire team also worked on setting up their views and models, I also managed to get the poller set up
    and loading without any crashes.

Journal Entry:
---

                Getting to sit down and write a bunch of code felt incredibly good. It feels like it has been a while that I have gotten a chance 
        to dig my teeth into some proper backend. I really enjoy creating APIs with Django and using Insomnia is such an easy time (although that
        definitely took some practice to perfect ðŸ˜…)
        Today was my first exposure to Live Share which was a little rocky to start, but Morgan and I ended up using it to GREAT success 
        while making the views for our microservice.

## July 12th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
*   Theorizing how the pollers will work and scaling from four microservices to two.

Journal Entry:
---

                Today was something I wasn't expecting at ALL. It felt so strange just to nuke half of our project, but still end up with the same functionality.
        It was actually pretty neat to take a step back and reoutline what we needed to do. Now we have a project with everything set up to funnel data
        into the proper places and queries will be MUCH easier with this implementation.

## July 11th, 2022

Today the entire team worked on:
* Getting the entire backend for the web app laid out!

Journal Entry:
---

                We spent a lot of time touching base on things and getting our models in order before even getting set up. 
        Once we had that, we each added our parts to the yaml file, and created our Microservices (Django projects + apps). 
        My specific microservice being Users, which comes with the Users and Quiz models.
                It was really great FINALLY getting to see what that create-multiple-databases file does. 
        I'm not the biggest fan of implementing code into my projects without knowing the "Why" behind it; 
        I'm so excited we got to get our hands on it and figure out how to set it up with our projects. 
        I think this is going to be a very fun project with very little stress as long as we keep communication up.
