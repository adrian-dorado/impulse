Today I worked on:

* Docker setup of my microservice, Clothing, with Django services.

* Collaborated on context map for site, as a group.

Definitely a good idea to make sure I have this microservice name, and not the default name from the docs, when setting up.

Getting a better handle on git merges, I think.
