Today I worked on:

* Docker setup of my microservice, Clothing, with Django services.

* Collaborated on context map for site, as a group.

Definitely a good idea to make sure I have this microservice name, and not the default name from the docs, when setting up.

Getting a better handle on git merges, I think.

* Collab'ed on more detailed context map, made flowchart of the 4 microservices.

* Started to implement backend of clothing microservice.

* Then discussion of the complexity of having so many microservices. Decided to pare the project down to just 2 microservices.

* Deleted the clothing microservice and added the skeletons of its models to products.

It was a little scary to collapse almost half the project but I think it was a good discussion and consideration of how to integrate everything. It would have been way more complex than needed, otherwise. And better to do a fundamental change now than later.

* Worked on models, views and registration for products service

* Tested the views

We used LiveShare for the first time, I like it, honestly.

We couldn't get the POST endpoint to work, but we may not need it for the project, we'll add products through the admin page.
